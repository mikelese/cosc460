Report for Lab 6
----------------

Exercise 1.

1. Briefly explain how logging is done in SimpleDB by describing when log records are written to the log.  Use Eclipse search tools to find all uses of the LogFile methods in the SimpleDB source code.

Log records (before state and current state) are written to the log prior in the flushPage function prior to the page itself being flushed to disk.

2. Where is LogFile.force called?  You should include usages inside other LogFile methods.  For each usage, why is it important that force is called?

Force is called after writing to the log, and at logfile.checkpoint, commit, and abort.

3. Where is setBeforeImage image called?  

It is called in the flushpages function.

Exercise 4.

In answering the next few questions, oncy include method calls in the source code; method calls in the test code can be ignored.

4. Where is BufferPool.flushPage called?  
    
  This is called in Transaction.transactionComplete, and flushpages, flushallpages.

5. Where is BufferPool.flushPages(tid) called?

    It is called from Transaction.transactionComplete

6. Where is BufferPool.flushAllPages called?

    It is called when a log checkpoint is made, in LogFile.

7. To support a NO FORCE, STEAL policy, describe exactly when/where pages should be flushed to disk.

After you complete the lab, please answer the following questions.  

8. What is your name?  If you work with a partner, be sure to write both of your names.

	Michael Lese

9. What did you think of this assignment?

    This assignment was straightforward and fair, the Logging was fairly straightforward to implement, the issue lay in the fact that I had to redo Bufferpool.

10. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

    Ensuring support of transactionTest, etc. while implementing new functionality.

11. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

   All of lab 6 is complete and functional. This completeness ensures that TransactionTest fails in some runs, though.
   
   If the changes to prevent transactionTest from failing are made, then two tests in lab6 fail, both versions are committed.

12. Roughly how long did you spend working on this lab?

	~12 hours, possibly more due to the catastrophic git corruption experienced Friday, and lab 5 patching.
