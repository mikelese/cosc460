Lab 4 Code Walk
---------------

Walk thru 1: simpledb.Parser.main() and simpledb.Parser.start()

	simpledb.Parser.main() is the entry point for the SimpleDB system. It calls simpledb.Parser.start(). The latter performs three main actions:
		1) It populates the SimpleDB catalog from the catalog text file provided by the user as argument (Database.getCatalog().loadSchema(argv[0]);).
		2) For each table defined in the system catalog, it computes statistics over the data in the table by calling: TableStats.computeStatistics(), which then does: TableStats s = new TableStats(tableid, IOCOSTPERPAGE);
		3) It processes the statements submitted by the user (processNextStatement(new ByteArrayInputStream(statementBytes));)

Walk thru 2: simpledb.Parser.processNextStatement()

	This method takes in the user input and attempts to parse it as SQL, using
	the Zql parsing library.  This method handles bad user input, as well as valid SQL statements include INSERT, DELETE, and SELECT statements.  

	We focus on the SELECT statement which is handled by 
		handleQueryStatement((ZQuery)s)
	This returns a Query object, which is then executed by calling
		query.execute();

Walk thru 3: simpledb.Parser.handleQueryStatement()

	This method first calls simpledb.Parser.parseQueryLogicalPlan(), which takes as its parameters the zQuery and the tid, and returns the logical plan to handle the query.
	It then gets the physical plan using the LogicalPlan.physicalPlan method (to be explained below).
	
Walk thru 4: simpledb.Parser.parseQueryLogicalPlan()

	parseQueryLogicalPlan then creates a logical plan, and parses through the tables in the from statement of the zQL query, adding any aliases and the table included in the from clause.
		
	The where clauses are then parsed and checked to see if there the current query is nested, which is unsupported, and processExpression is called on each parsed valid expression. 
	
	processExpression gets the operator (only AND is supported), and operands of each expression, and handles for the case where there are multiple chained operators by treating them associatively.
	
	 

	Note: this method is rather long and complex.  Your walk thru should focus
	on the high-level ideas.  Specifically, explain how SQL query is processed to construct the LogicalPlan.  
 
Walk thru 5: simpledb.LogicalPlan.physicalPlan()

	Your walk thru should explain how these data structures are used:
		- equivMap
		- filterSelectivities
		- statsMap
		- subplanMap
