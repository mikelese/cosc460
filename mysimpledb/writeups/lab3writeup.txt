Report for Lab 3
----------------

Answer the questions from the lab description here.  Questions 8 and 9 do not require answers.

1. 
Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, Operator, OrderBy, Project, SeqScan, TupleIterator

2. 
Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, OrderBy, Project

3.
Project, Join, Theta Join? (HashEquiJoin), Select (Filter), Difference (by Delete?), Union (by insert).

4.
Filter implements the DBIterator interface, despite not implementing next and hasNext, because it inherits the methods from Operator, its superclass.

5.

if iterR.hasNext():
	r = iterR.next()
	while r not matches predicate or not iterR.hasNext():
		r = iterR.next
	
	if r matches predicate:
		return r
	else:
		return null
return null

6.
list = []
while iterR.hasNext():
	rTup = iterR.next() 
	while iterS.hasNext():
		sTup = iterS.next()
		if rTup and sTup match join predicate:
			newTup = merge(rTup, sTup)
			list.append(newTup)
	iterS.rewind()
return list
		
7.

if t1 == null:
	if iterR.hasNext():
		t1 = iterR.next()
	else:
		return null

while sTup.hasNext():
	if iterS.hasNext():
		t2 = iterS.next() #questionable
		while not sTup and rTup match join predicate:
              		t2  = iterS.next()
		if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
			return merge(t1, t2)
	if iterR.hasNext():	
		t1 = iterR.next()
	else:
		break

	iterS.rewind()  
return null

After you complete lab 3, please answer the following questions.  

1. What is your name?  If you work with a partner, be sure to write both of your names.

Michael Lese. I did not work with a partner.

2. What did you think of this assignment?

I thought it was a fair assignment. It took a more than an insubstantial amount of work, but it was a good way to understand relational algebra and database operations/queries. There wasn't too much debugging required.

3. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

Translating the SQL queries took some thought, and there was a mild off by one error that needed correction in my implementation of the DbIterator interface.

4. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

It's all there.

5. Roughly how long did you spend working on this lab?

It was probably around 8 hours, give or take 90 minutes.
