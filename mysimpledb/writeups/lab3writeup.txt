Report for Lab 3
----------------

Answer the questions from the lab description here.  Questions 8 and 9 do not require answers.

1. 
Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, Operator, OrderBy, Project, SeqScan, TupleIterator

2. 
Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, OrderBy, Project

3.
Project, Join, Theta Join? (HashEquiJoin), Select (Filter), Difference (by Delete?), Union (by insert).

4.
Filter implements the DBIterator interface, despite not implementing next and hasNext, because it inherits the methods from Operator, its superclass.

5.

if iterR.hasNext():
	r = iterR.next()
	while r not matches predicate or not iterR.hasNext():
		r = iterR.next
	
	if r matches predicate:
		return r
	else:
		return null
return null

6.
list = []
while iterR.hasNext():
	rTup = iterR.next() 
	while iterS.hasNext():
		sTup = iterS.next()
		if rTup and sTup match join predicate:
			newTup = merge(rTup, sTup)
			list.append(newTup)
	iterS.rewind()
return list
		
7.

if t1 == null:
	if iterR.hasNext():
		t1 = iterR.next()
	else:
		return null

while sTup.hasNext():
	if iterS.hasNext():
		t2 = iterS.next() #questionable
		while not sTup and rTup match join predicate:
              		t2  = iterS.next()
		if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
			return merge(t1, t2)
	if iterR.hasNext():	
		t1 = iterR.next()
	else:
		break

	iterS.rewind()  
return null
